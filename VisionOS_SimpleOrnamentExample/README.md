# VisionOS Ornaments

This folder contains a super stripped down app meant to illustrate how you can include an ornaments in your VisionOS application for the Apple Vision Pro. This code is meant to accompany this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvkzHuTsVKM), which dives deeper into what ornaments are and how they can help to provide a smoother, cleaner user experience within your apps. 

Here's a screenshot of the final output. You'll notice a background was assigned to the ornament, it spans the full width of the accompanying primary view, and it is offset so as to appear as a completely separated entity. Take a look at the code or check out the video for more info!
