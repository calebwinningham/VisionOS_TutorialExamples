# VisionOS - Using Particles to Create Weather Effects

This folder contains a super stripped down app meant to illustrate how you can leverage particles in create weather effects within your immersive scene. Though this specific example uses a "Snow" effect, there are several others already built in like "Rain" or another similar to "Fog" that will follow this general pattern as well. From there, using custom particles to enhance an immersive experience is really only limited by your imagination. The video this was created for can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiSY7yUNmxk). 

Below's a screenshot of the final output. You'll notice a background was assigned to the ornament, it spans the full width of the accompanying primary view, and it is offset so as to appear as a completely separated entity. Take a look at the code or check out the video for more info!
