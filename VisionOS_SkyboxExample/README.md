# VisionOS - Skybox Example

This folder contains a basic approach to creating a Skybox. These are really helpful for creating super simple immersive scenes and can be leveraged in part of creating really complex scenes as well. Regardless of your end goal for this, Skyboxes are a great thing to be familiar and to have in your back pocket. The video this was created for can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UpkPPbB2ew). 

Below's a screenshot of the final output. This image is 360 degrees and, when in the Vision Pro, the user can look anywhere they want and still exist within this Skybox immersive scene environment.
