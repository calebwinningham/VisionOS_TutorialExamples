# VisionOS - Using Particles to Create Weather Effects

This folder contains an example of how to setup and trigger Spatial Audio within your Vision Pro application. While this specific example is centered on using one of the built in sounds from the sound Library in Reality Composer Pro, this approach will work with virtually any audio file you add to your project. No screen shot in this case, but checkout this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wq-E4VaVZ4) which this project was built for to see, or in this case hear, things in action!
